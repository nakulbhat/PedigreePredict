# Pedigree Charts and Linked Lists

This project implements a linked-list based data structure and algorithms for an active memory representation of a pedigree chart. It is designed to handle incomplete pedigrees effectively.

## Idea

The concept centers on probabilistic expectations for pedigree analysis. While inherited pedigrees can be calculated easily with known parental genotypes, challenges arise when parental information is missing. This program models the inheritance process mathematically, offering an implementation of that theory along with a user-friendly interface suitable for use by healthcare professionals.

## Features

- **Linked List Structure**: Efficiently represents complex pedigree relationships.
- **Incomplete Data Handling**: Supports analysis even when parental genotypes are unknown.
- **Probabilistic Inheritance Modeling**: Uses mathematical formulas to predict inherited traits.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with healthcare professionals in mind for ease of use.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nakulbhat/PedigreePredict.git
